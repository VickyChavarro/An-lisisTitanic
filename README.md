- The project's primary objective was to develop a predictive model that would estimate the probability of survival of Titanic passengers, with this estimation being based on the individuals' personal and socio-economic characteristics. The primary objective was to ascertain which types of people were most likely to survive the sinking of the renowned RMS Titanic.

- The analysis was conducted using two datasets provided by Kaggle: the first, designated as `train.csv`, contained comprehensive data on 891 passengers, including their survival status; the second, labelled as `test.csv`, encompassed analogous information for an additional 418 passengers, omitting the information regarding survival. The objective was to train a model with the training dataset (`train.csv`), and subsequently utilise this model to predict the survival of passengers in the test set (`test.csv`). The performance of the model was evaluated using the Kaggle leaderboard.

- During the modelling phase, a range of algorithms were investigated in order to ascertain which provided the most accurate predictions. The models that were utilised in this process included Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Boosting Forest Model, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Logistic Regression was selected due to its capacity to manage categorical variables and its interpretability of coefficients associated with each passenger characteristic. Ensemble models, such as Random Forest and Boosting, exhibited superior accuracy by integrating multiple decision trees, thereby facilitating the capture of intricate patterns present in the data.

- The final selected model was optimised through cross-validation and hyperparameter adjustments, ensuring that overfitting was minimised and that the model generalised correctly to new data. The performance of the model in predicting survival in the test set was assessed by comparing the results with the ground truth, which was not revealed during the training process.
